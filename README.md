Hey everyone! Here's the Giphy-Api homework assignment. Click on the two gifs to turn on and off the animation. I ran into a problem on this assignment. Once you click on your favorite TV show and ten still gifs appear, I could only get one gif to animate and then stop. It was always the first gif and it only did it once. Like it was one big div for all then pics. I couldn't figure out how to create a div for each gif dynamcially once appended. Thanks for checking out my homework!
